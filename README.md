## reputation

Some applications online will require some kind of validation that the address being used
to access meets a certain criteria  example criteria:
 <ol>
    <li>Check if an address belongs to a human being</li>
    <li>Check if a person is a member of a group</li>
    <li>Check if a address can be trusted for a certain onchain activity</li>
 </ol>

Different applications require different levels of trust and methods of gaining the necessary trust.

sources.
